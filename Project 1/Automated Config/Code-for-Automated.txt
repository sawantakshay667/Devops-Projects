 open your terminal, Create a new directory
# mkdir webserver

 Now use the vagrant init command to initialise a new vagrant machine.
# vagrant init ubuntu/jammy64

Then, boot up the virtual machine with:
# vagrant up

 Automated the below process
 1. Install the list of packages
 2. Upgrade & update the ubuntu
 3. Install the web server
 4. Allow to access web server using port 80
 
 Now your VM will auto shutdown, Now you enable adapter 2 >> Network >> Bridged Adapter > Select your network adapter >> start the VM.
 
 Now you access the VM
# vagrant ssh

 Set up networking, i am assigned my network ip. you can change the network.sh file
# ./ 

We can access the web server from inside the VM. But we want to access the website in a proper web browser. How do we access it from outside the VM (from our desktop)? We’ll need to understand a little about networking, which we’ll do next.

 How to see your VM’s network configuration
ip a

# Stop the ubuntu VM, enable adapter 2 >> Network >> Bridged Adapter > Select your network adapter >> start the VM.
# Run the below cmd. In My Case, My adapter logical name is "enp0s8", 
ip a

# Adapter set the down. for set the ip address
sudo ip link set dev enp0s8 down

# set the static ip for VM, assign the ip from your network with subnetmask"
sudo ip addr add "Ip of your network with /24" dev enp0s8

# Adapter set the up
sudo ip link set dev enp0s8 up

# add the your gateway ip in routing table 
sudo ip route add default via "gateway-IP"

# Confirme the ip in routing table
ip route show

## Now you can access the webserver using VM-ip:80

### Add some website content
# default file location is /var/www/html, Edit the index.html page

## Now, you can access website using "vm-enp0s8-ip:80"
